## Introduction
This project implements a voting system in Java. The system supports creating various voting sessions with multiple options, anonymous or public voting, and displaying results.

## Class Structure
1. **Person**: Stores voter information.
2. **Vote**: Holds the details of each vote, including the voter and the date.
3. **Voting**: Defines and manages a voting session and stores votes.
4. **VotingSystem**: Manages multiple voting sessions and provides access to information.
5. **Main**: Tests and demonstrates an example of a voting session.

## Usage
- Run the `Main` class to see how the system works.
- The system allows adding multiple voting sessions and recording votes from users.

## Running the Project
1. Open the project in a Java development environment.
2. Run the `Main` class to view a sample voting session and display results.

## Notes
- This project is implemented with object-oriented principles and standard Java structures.
- Collections and random functions are used for storing votes and random voting.
